WP Better\r\nEmails wraps them with a much better looking customizable **HTML email template** and lets you also set your own **sender name** and **email address**.\r\n\r\n* WP Better Emails comes with a default simple and clean template that has been tested on various and popular email clients\r\n like Gmail, Yahoo Mail, Hotmail/Live, AOL, Outlook, Apple Mail and many more. This to ensure your emails will always display\r\nnicely in your recipient mailbox. But you can of course design your own.\r\n* WP Better Emails lets you send sample emails to test and preview your own custom HTML email template.\r\n* Watch your HTML email template during editing with the live preview.\r\n* Fancy HTML editor with CodeMirror syntax highlighting.\r\n* All emails sent by this plugin are sent as 'multipart' so that email clients that don't support HTML can read them.\r\n* Include some dynamic tags in your template such as your blog URL, home URL, blog name, blog description, admin email or date and time. They will all be\r\nreplaced when sending the email.\r\n* Add your own tags with Wordpress filters (see [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-better-emails/faq/) for usage).\r\n* The default template is included as an HTML file in the plugin folder, feel free to edit it with your favorite editor.\r\n* Clean uninstall process, doesn't leave some useless data in your database when deleted, you can easily give it a try !\r\n\r\n= Example usages : =\r\n\r\n* Add some ads/sponsored links to every email sent with wordpress\r\n* Include some banners to promote a special event or feature of your website\r\n* Brand your emails to your website or client website\r\n\r\n= Internationalization =\r\n\r\nWP Better Emails is currently available in :\r\n\r\n* English\r\n* French\r\n* German - [Robert Tremmel](http://roberttremmel.de/ \"Robert Tremmel\")\r\n* Hebrew - [Avi Ben-Avraham](mailto:avi@nrich.co.il \"Avi Ben-Avraham\")\r\n* Turkish - [Ünsal Korkmaz](http://www.unsalkorkmaz.com/ \"Ünsal Korkmaz\")\r\n* Italian - [Fabio Lelli](http://www.synaestesia.com/ \"Fabio Lelli\")\r\n* Arabic - [Yaser Maadan](http://www.englize.com/ \"Yaser Maadan\")\r\n* Simplified Chinese - [Will Yuan](http://yslove.net/ \"Will Yuan\")\r\n\r\nI'm looking for translators to extend to other languages. If you have translated the plugin in your language or want to,\r\nplease let me know : plugins [ at ] artyshow-studio.fr\r\n\r\n= Credits =\r\n\r\n[CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/ \"CodeMirror\") library\r\n\r\n== Installation ==\r\n\r\n1. Extract and upload the `wp-better-emails` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory\r\n2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress admin panel\r\n3. (Optional) Set a sender email and name, if none, wordpress defaults will be used : 'wordpress@yourdomain.com' and 'Your Blog Title'\r\n4. (Optional) Edit your own email template. See the screenshot tab to have a look at the default template\r\n5. Every email going out from your Wordpress Blog (notifications, lost password, etc.) looks better now !\r\n\r\n== Upgrade Notice ==\r\n\r\nIf you're using the default template provided with WP Better Emails, you should delete the plugin and reinstall it to make sure you have the lastest template improvements. \r\n\r\nIf you have customized the HTML template and want to keep it, just update.\r\n\r\n= Manual update =\r\n\r\n1. Delete the plugin `wp-better-emails` folder under the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory\r\n2. Upload the last version and activate it\r\n\r\n= Automatic update =\r\n\r\nJust use the Wordpress automatic plugin update system\r\n\r\n== Frequently Asked Questions ==\r\n\r\n= What if recipient can't read HTML emails ? =\r\n\r\nWP Better Emails sends all emails in both formats ('multipart', i.e. HTML and plain text) so that emails can be displayed in every email client.\r\n\r\n= Why are the emails still sent in plain text format ? =\r\n\r\nBe sure to include the **%content%** tag in your template. WP Better Emails wrap the content with the template, if no tag\r\nis found, sending HTML emails is automatically desactivated.\r\n\r\n= How does WP Better Emails interact with others plugins ? =\r\n\r\nWP Better Emails wraps every \"plain/text\" email sent with the Wordpress function `wp_mail()`.\r\n\r\n= I totally messed up with the template, how can I get the original one ? =\r\n\r\nJust delete and reinstall the plugin from the admin panel. \r\n\r\n= How can I add my own tags ? =\r\n\r\nYou can filter the tags array and add your replacements. Let's say you want to randomly display some sponsored links somewhere in your email template:\r\n\r\n\tadd_filter('wpbe_tags', 'add_my_tags');\r\n\tfunction add_my_tags( $tags ) {\r\n\t\t$ads = array('<a href=\"#\">Sponsored link 1</a>', '<a href=\"#\">Sponsored link 2</a>', '<a href=\"#\">Sponsored link 3</a>');\r\n\t\t$tags['sponsored_link'] = $ads[array_rand($ads, 1)];\r\n\t\treturn $tags;\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nThe key of the array `sponsored_link` will be a new tag (`%sponsored_link%`) you can include. It will be randomly replaced with one of your sponsored links.\r\n\r\nThe example above is taking sponsored links as an additinonal content but you can imagine anything like including lastest posts, a quote of the day or whatever.\r\nYou can place this function in your functions.php theme file or in a plugin.\r\n\r\n== Screenshots ==\r\n\r\n1.
